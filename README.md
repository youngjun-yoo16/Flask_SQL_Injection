# Flask_SQL_Injection

This repository was created for the pre-development research at Fasoo. <br />
I made this website intentionally vulnerable to SQL injection to see whether Sparrow's SAST engine could detect the vulnerability in a Flask environment.

## Skill Stacks

`Frontend`  : `HTML5` and `CSS3` with `Jinja2` template engine

`Backend`   : `Flask` and `SQLite` connected with `SQLAlchemy`
